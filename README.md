# Doggo information system
This application is being build by Stenden students (IT3) for the threading final assignment.

## Basic idea:
We are making a program for dog lovers to use to find information about doggos. 
Have a list of dogs where the user gets to select a breed of dog. 
Then the system will retrieve the information from several websites and print out within the GUI. 
The GUI will also hold statistics of dog breeds, for example their average age.
This will help dog lovers find their ideal dog for them by looking at different dog breeds and also looking at the statistics of dog breeds.
